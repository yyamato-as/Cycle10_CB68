%%%%% How to convert this document to PDF %%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% If your figures are stored as PostScript files, you can use the 
% following commands to generate a PDF file of your proposal:

%% latex file.tex
%% dvips file.dvi
%% ps2pdf file.ps file.pdf 


% If your figures are PDF images or bitmap pictures in PNG, JPG, or GIF format,
% you can use the pdflatex command to generate a PDF file from this template
% (note, however, that the pdflatex command does not handle PostScript files):

% pdflatex file.tex

% Warnings: 
%           1. You must make sure that PDF output generated from this
%              template is complete both when displayed with a viewer 
%              (acroread, for example) and when printed on paper.
%              LaTeX installations vary greatly and therefore it might 
%              not be possible to get all proposals to come out 
%              correctly with a single text page layout. 
%              In some cases you will have to adjust the 
%              \topmargin=-7mm command in the template to center the 
%              text vertically in the page.  
%           2. The scientific justification, figures, tables, references,
%              and public outreach statement must all fit within the
%              4-page limit.
%           3. You are free to include colour images in your proposal justification.
%              Proposals are distributed to ALMA Review Panels and to distributed
%              peer review reviewers in electronic form.
%              However, the scientific content of the images should still remain
%              clear when displayed or printed in black and white.
%           4. This template is for regular, ToO, DDT, or mm-VLBI ALMA proposals,
%              but NOT for Large Programs: these have a separate template with
%              more sections, and is available from the ALMA Science Portal
